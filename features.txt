The Master Chief is a towering biochemically and cybernetically-enhanced supersoldier, raised and trained from an early age to be a weapon; he is almost faceless, never seen without his green-colored armor and helmet. He is commonly referred to by his naval rank, rather than his given birth-name or serial-designation. The character is voiced by Steve Downes, a Chicago disc jockey, in the video games in which he appears. Downes based his personification of the Chief on an initial character sketch which called for a Clint Eastwoodâ€“type character of few words.
